\subsection{Skeleton Extraction}
In section~\ref{subsubsec:l1 median based}, we have introduced much information about $\ell_1$ median and its success in point cloud consolidation.
Except for reducing 2D surface that approximate origin point set,
\cite{huang2013l1} observed that adapting $\ell_1$ medians $locally$ to a point set representing a geometric shape also gives rise to a $one~dimensional$ structure which can be seen as a localized center of the shape, i.e., a medial curve skeleton, which can be used for shape abstraction and consequently an effective tool for shape analysis and manipulation\cite{cornea2007curve}.

Without building any point connectivity or estimating point normals,
by modifying the repulsion term $E_2$ in~(\ref{eq:LOP2}) and proposing a different weighted density parameter that can also be named WLOP\cite{huang2009consolidation},
they project point samples onto their local centers with growing neighborhood and push the projected samples via conditional regularization to obtain a uniform distribution of samples along skeleton branches. To deal with some data errors like holes, they also do more processing which is out of our scope.
Figure~\ref{fig:skeleton extraction} shows an example.

\subsection{Deformation-Constrained Modeling}

Constrained modeling is an important tool for the modification of 3D geometric models.
Local control, in contrast to some global algorithms, is designed for adjusting $as~ few~ vertices~ as~ possible$ in order not to influence the regions that are already satisfactory.
To automatically explore a local deformation which satisfies all constraints, \cite{deng2013exploring} gives a novel framework using $\ell_{2,1}$ sparse regularization penalty.

For a mesh with vertices $\{v_{i}\}{_{1}^{n}}$,
$\mathbf{p}=[\mathbf{p}{_{1}^{T}},\cdots, \mathbf{p}{_{n}^{T}}]^{T}\in \mathbb{R}^{3n}$ is the position vector.
$E_{j}(\mathbf{p})=0(j=1,\cdots,m)$ denotes the constraints satisfactory.
Then from a given mesh $\mathbf{p}^0$ and the target positions of vertices(handles) $\{v_{i}|i\in\Gamma\}$ specified by a user,
the deformation is achieved by computing the displacement
$\mathbf{d}=[\mathbf{d}{_{1}^{T}},\cdots, \mathbf{d}{_{n}^{T}}]^{T}\in \mathbb{R}^{3n}$, with
$\mathbf{d}_{k}\in\mathbb{R}^3$ corresponding to vertex $v_{k}$,
by the following optimization problem

\small{
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:localmodeling1}
 \begin{split}
 & \min_{\mathbf{d}}  \frac{\omega_{h}}{2} \sum_{i\in\Gamma}^{} \| \mathbf{d}_{i}- \widetilde{\mathbf{d}_{i}} \|{_2^2}
                      +\frac{\omega_{s}}{2} \sum_{i\notin\Gamma}^{} \| \mathbf{d}_{i} \|_2
                      +\frac{\omega_{f}}{2} \| \mathbf{Ed} \|{_2^2},\\
 & ~\textrm{s.t.}~ E_{j}(\mathbf{p}^0+\mathbf{d})=0,~j=1,\cdots,m,
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
}
\\
where $\widetilde{\mathbf{d}_{i}}$ in the first term is the target displacement of the handle vertex $v_{i}$,
the second $\ell_{2,1}$ term minimizing the $\ell_1$ norm of vector $[\|\mathbf{d}_1\|_2,\cdots,\|\mathbf{d}_n\|_2]$ reduces the sparsity of $\mathbf{d}$,
and last term is for a smooth displacement for a nice shape.
With fixed weight $\mathbf{\omega}=(\omega_{h},\omega_{s},\omega_{f})$, the resulted single solution $\mathbf{d}$ may not satisfy the user's intent.

Then to enrich the solution while preserving nice shapes of meshes,
based on the modified mesh $\mathbf{p}^0+\mathbf{d}$ denoted as $\mathbf{p}^{+}$,
they compute a local modification space
$S_{\mathbf{p}^{+}}=\{ \mathbf{p}^{+}+\mathbf{t}~|~\mathbf{t}\in \mathcal{S}_{\mathbf{p}^{+}} \}$ spanned by an orthonormal basis $\mathbf{t}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{s}_1$,
where $\mathcal{S}_{\mathbf{p}^{+}}$ is a linear subspace of
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathbf{p}^{+}}=\{ \mathbf{t}~|~\nabla E_{j}(\mathbf{p})\cdot \mathbf{t}=0,j=1,\cdots,m \}$
representing displacements from $\mathbf{p}$ that satisfy the constraints up to first order.
Also taking shape quality and sparsity into consideration, this problem is finally formulated as

\small{
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:localmodeling1}
 \begin{split}
 & \min_{\mathbf{t}}  \frac{\beta_{f}}{2} \| \mathbf{Ed} \|{_2^2}
                      +\frac{\beta_{h}}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{s} \| \mathbf{t}_{i} \|{_2^2}
                      +\frac{\beta_{s}}{2} \| \mathbf{t} \|_{2,1}
                      -\frac{\beta_{c}}{2} C(\mathbf{t}),\\
 & ~\textrm{s.t.}~ \| \mathbf{t} \|_2=1,~\mathbf{Jt}=\mathbf{0},~\mathbf{B}^{T}\mathbf{t}=0.
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
}
\\
obviously, the third term is for the sparse displacement $\mathbf{t}$
with the first two term for shape quality and
the last term for the sparsity of $\mathbf{d}+\mathbf{t}$.


After the interactive exploration, the final result is optimized to fully satisfy the set of constraints(Figure~\ref{fig:localmodeling}).

\input{TV}  % shape matching

% considering important propertices, like their structural stability, aesthetics of a surface
%Especially in the case of modeling man-made structure like architecture or machine parts, geometric constraints are able to create and preserve ubiquitous alignment properties like element parallelism, conllinearity, fixed angles and distances, or symmetry relations.
%
%Generally, in an interactive 3D modeling system,
%it is crucial for each atomic editing operation to adjust as few auxiliary vertices as possible in order not to destroy the user's earlier editing effort,
%and the whole constraint resolution pipeline is required to run in real-time to enable a fluent, interactive workflow.
%
%To address both issues, \cite{habbecke2012linear} presents an interactive constrained modeling with a well-defined strategy that, for an atomic editing operation, computes $as~small~as~possible$ model updates in terms of the total number of adjusted vertices.
%
%For a model instance $\mathbf{X}^0$ whose elements are the vertex positions,
%a vector-valued functions $\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{X}^0)=\mathbf{0}$ denotes the satisfaction for all constraints.
%Then for a given editing displacement $\mathbf{d}$ corresponding to one user editing operation, the central goal is to find a correction displacement $\mathbf{d'}$  such that $\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{X}^0+\mathbf{d}+\mathbf{d'})=\mathbf{0}$, where the zero elements of $\mathbf{d'}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ are disjoint and $\mathbf{d'}$ should be as sparse as possible.
%
%Suppose the space of possible movements of each vertex $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ is represented with a basis $\{\mathbf{b}_{i,1},\mathbf{b}_{i,1},\mathbf{b}_{i,3}\}$, $\mathbf{b}_{i,k} \in \mathbb{R}^3$,
%they extend the 3-dimensional basis vectors to vectors $\mathbf{B}_{i,k}:=(0,...,0,\mathbf{b}{_{i,k}^{T}},0,...,0) \in \mathbb{R}^{3n}$ to represent the correction displacement $\mathbf{d'}$ with a linear combination
%
%\small{
%\begin{equation}
% \label{eq:ConstrainedModeling1}
% \mathbf{d'} := \sum_{i\notin I(\mathbf{b})}^{}\sum_{k=1}^{3}\alpha_{i,k}\mathbf{B}_{i,k}.
%\end{equation}
%}
%\\
%then the computation of the correction of displacement $\mathbf{d'}$ is actually to compute the non-zero coefficient $\alpha_{i,k}$.
%They firstly determine its non-zero set in analysis phase by solving
%
%\small{
%\begin{equation}
% \label{eq:ConstrainedModeling2}
% \sum_{i\notin I(\mathbf{d})}^{}\sum_{k=1}^{3}\alpha_{i,k}P\mathbf{B}_{i,k}=-P\mathbf{d}.
%\end{equation}
%}
%\\
%using $Orthogonal~Matching~Pursuit$(OMP)\cite{tropp2007signal},
%and here $P$ is the constraints' Jacobian $J_{\mathbf{c}}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 3n}$.
%
%Then the solution phase is designed to compute its values as
%
%\small{
%\begin{equation}
% \label{eq:ConstrainedModeling3}
% E(\{\alpha_{i,k}|(i,k)\in \Lambda\})=\sum_{j\in C}^{}c{_j^2}(\mathbf{X}_0+\mathbf{d}+\sum_{}^{}\alpha_{i,k}\mathbf{B}_{i,k}),
%\end{equation}
%}
%\\
%Figure~\ref{fig:constraint modeling} shows one modeling result. In this paper, each editing operation is performed on a input model instance that satisfies all predefined constraints, due to the sparsity of solutions, this strong assumption can not result in some limitations. But changing the predefined constraint types or the number of the constraints may result in failure cases.
