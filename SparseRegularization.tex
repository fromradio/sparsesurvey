\subsection{Skeleton Extraction}
In section~\ref{subsubsec:$L_1$ median based}, we have introduced much information about $\ell_1$ median and its success in point cloud consolidation.
Except for reducing 2D surface that approximate origin point-set,
\cite{huang2013l1} observed that adapting $\ell_1$ medians $locally$ to a point set representing a geometric shape also gives rise to a $one-dimensional$ structure which can be seen as a localized center of the shape, i.e., a medial curve skeleton that can be used for shape abstraction and consequently an effective tool for shape analysis and manipulation\cite{cornea2007curve}.
Without building any point connectivity or estimating point normals, they directly project point samples onto their local centers as $l_1$ medians with growing neighborhood and push the projected samples via conditional regularization to obtain a uniform distribution of samples along skeleton branches.

It is intuitively a modification of LOP by modifying the repulsion term $E_2$ in~(\ref{eq:LOP2}) and proposing a different weighted density parameter that can also be named WLOP\cite{huang2009consolidation}. Re-centering. Figure~\ref{fig:skeleton extraction} shows an example.

\subsection{Constrained Modeling}

Constrained modeling is an important tool for the construction and modification of 3D geometric models.
Especially in the case of modeling man-made structure like architecture or machine parts, geometric constraints are able to create and preserve ubiquitous alignment properties like element parallelism, conllinearity, fixed angles and distances, or symmetry relations.

Generally, analyzing and solving constraint systems usually fail to meet two main challenges of an interactive 3D modeling system: for each atomic editing operation,
it is crucial to adjust as few auxiliary vertices as possible in order to not destroy the user's earlier editing effort;
the whole constraint resolution pipeline is required to run in real-time to enable a fluent, interactive workflow.

To address both issues, \cite{habbecke2012linear} presents a novel interactive constrained modeling with a well-defined strategy that, for an atomic editing operation, computes $as~small~as~possible$ model updates in terms of the total number of adjusted vertices.

Mathematically, a model instance $\mathbf{X}_0$, whose elements are the vertex positions, satisfies all constraints denoted by $\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{X}_0)=\mathbf{0}$ which is a vector-valued function. Then for a given editing displacement $\mathbf{d}$ corresponding to one user editing operation, the central goal is to find a correction displacement $\mathbf{d'}$  such that $\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{X}_0+\mathbf{d}+\mathbf{d'})=\mathbf{0}$, where the zero elements of $\mathbf{d'}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ are disjoint and $\mathbf{d'}$ should be as sparse as possible.

If the space of possible movements of each vertex $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ is represented with a basis $\{\mathbf{b}_{i,1},\mathbf{b}_{i,1},\mathbf{b}_{i,3}\}$, $\mathbf{b}_{i,k} \in \mathbb{R}^3$, after extending the 3-dimensional basis vectors to vectors $\mathbf{B}_{i,k}:=(0,...,0,\mathbf{b}{_{i,k}^{T}},0,...,0) \in \mathbb{R}^{3n}$ with $3(i-1)$ leading zeros, the correction displacement $\mathbf{d'}$ can then be represented as linear combination

\small{
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:ConstrainedModeling1}
 \mathbf{d'} := \sum_{i\notin I(\mathbf{b})}^{}\sum_{k=1}^{3}\alpha_{i,k}\mathbf{B}_{i,k}.
\end{equation}
}

So the computation of the correction of displacement $\mathbf{d'}$ is actually to compute the non-zero coefficient $\alpha_{i,k}$.
They firstly determine its non-zero set in analysis phase by solving

\small{
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:ConstrainedModeling2}
 \sum_{i\notin I(\mathbf{d})}^{}\sum_{k=1}^{3}\alpha_{i,k}P\mathbf{B}_{i,k}=-P\mathbf{d}.
\end{equation}
}
\\
using $Orthogonal~Matching~Pursuit$(OMP)\cite{tropp2007signal},
and here $P$ is the constraints' Jacobian $J_{\mathbf{c}}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 3n}$.

Then the solution phase is designed to compute its values as

\small{
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:ConstrainedModeling3}
 E(\{\alpha_{i,k}|(i,k)\in \Lambda\})=\sum_{j\in C}^{}c{_j^2}(\mathbf{X}_0+\mathbf{d}+\sum_{}^{}\alpha_{i,k}\mathbf{B}_{i,k}),
\end{equation}
}
\\
Figure~\ref{fig:constraint modeling} shows one modeling result. In this paper, each editing operation is performed on a input model instance that satisfies all predefined constraints, due to the sparsity of solutions, this strong assumption can not result in some limitations. But changing the predefined constraint types or the number of the constraints may result in failure cases.
