\section{The Problems of Sparse Coding}
There are many basic different aspects in sparse coding problems such as finding the coefficients, learning the basis vectors, matrix factorization etc.
At the very first, we briefly introduce some popular sparse methods for machine learning.
Recall that the target of sparse coding is to find as small number of basis vectors as possible to represent an input vector.
A common formulation for this problem is that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cl}
\min_{\mathbf{a}} & \|\mathbf{a}\|_0\\
\mathrm{s.t.} & \|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\mathbf{a}\|_2 \leq \epsilon.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Here $\mathbf{X}=(\mathbf{x}_1,\,\mathbf{x}_2,\cdots ,\,\mathbf{x}_n)$ denotes the dictionary matrix collecting all basis vectors.
